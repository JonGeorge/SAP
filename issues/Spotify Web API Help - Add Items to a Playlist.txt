I am attempting to programmatically add Spotify tracks to a playlist, however, I've run into a pickle.

If I attempt to add 6 or less tracks to a playlist, no tracks are added to the playlist and no errors are returned. In fact, I receive the expected response from Spotify - the snapshot_id with a status of 201 'Created'.

If I attempt to add more than 6 tracks at one time, all tracks up to the sixth to last get added to the playlist. For example, if I attempt to add 10 tracks to a playlist, only the first 4 will be added.

This is a NodeJS application. I have tried using various libraries for making http requests including node-fetch, axios, and request - all with the same outcome.
I have also tried using the old Spotify playlist endpoint to no avail.

Below are two attempts at adding tracks to playlist using two different endpoints using the node-fetch npm package. In both cases the request body has 25 tracks, but only the first 19 are added to the playlist.

fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/${playlist_id}/tracks`,

Here are the response headers after making a request to add 6 tracks to a playlist using axios - no tracks are added:

    status: 201,
    statusText: 'Created',
    headers:
    {

        method: 'post',
        data:'{"uris":["spotify:track:7zr0cqz7q0N3ED57wcEZVY","spotify:track:1JwqcbApkpl4PGeJZVq6KX","spotify:track:752es5q8G4DIqdJpJPVDwX","spotify:track:6qRHYEALF2n8AO79DcxfeY","spotify:track:6qS6HJ9ZllRugn6PjnUZZy","spotify:track:4XCflK0Q5WmpaQFsh6ly8C"]}', 
        headers:

            'User-Agent': 'axios/0.21.1',
            'Content-Length': 244 
        }

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}

Lastly, I have attempted using the Spotify Developer Console to execute this same request and experience the same behavior. The snapshot id is returned, it looks like everything worked flawlessly until I actually check the playlist...still empty.
BUT, Spotify allows you to "Fill sample data" in their developer console. If I keep my request the same as it's been, and add their sample tracks into my request body at any position in the uris array, only those two tracks get added to my playlist!
Can someone help me out here? What am I missing?
